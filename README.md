### Motivation

Taiwanese people are proud of being the citizens of the country of "bubble tea". However, consequently, Taiwan is also one of few countries with highest rate of Diabetes. According to the government's report, diabetes patients account for 11% of total adults (18 - 64) in 2019, and this astonishingly high amount keeps increasing.

In light of this, I was inspired to establish a data analysis and machine learning project based on Diabetes survey data on Kaggle.com and build up an interactive user interface to make the public more aware of the risk and consequence of diabetes.

Via the interactive user interface built on Streamlit, user could input their age, height, weight, and their basic health condition and the model would return the probability of diagnosed as diabetes.

- Data preprocessing (Outlier analysis)
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Selection
  - EDA for binary features
  - EDA for non-binary features
  - Correlation Analysis
  - Feature Importance
  - Feature Selection
  
- Model Selection
  - Cross-Validation
  - Precision-Recall Curve Analysis
  - ROC Analysis

- Model Evaluation & Hyper Parameter Tuning

- Final Model Training & Model Output

- User Interface Establishment by Streamlit
